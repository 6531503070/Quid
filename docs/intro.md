# Introduction

Quid is an unique identifier inspired by [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) and [cuid2](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2)

:::info
**Quid** is designed for human-friendly, versioned, and k-sortable unique IDs, ideal for modern distributed systems.
:::

## ðŸš€ Features

- <strong>Version-detectable</strong>: The uid can represent the version of item/entity data schema
- <strong>K-Sortable</strong>: The uid can be K-sortable as it is time-based
- <strong>Random-Customizable</strong>: The random specification can be customized, by providing a config
- <strong>Human-Friendly</strong>: Human-friendly writing and reading, as it is represented as <a href="https://base64.guru/standards/base64url">base64url</a>

## ðŸ§¬ Quid's Data Structure

Quid IDs are always 26 fixed characters long, encoded in [base64url](https://base64.guru/standards/base64url), and contain version, timestamp, and uniqueness information.

**<u>Structure</u>: `vvvttttttttUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU`** (26 fixed characters, 156 bits)
